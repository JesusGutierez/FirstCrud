# First Crud with Spring Boot and Java

This is my first Api with Spring Boot and Java. â˜•

1. You need to create a file called "application.properties" in "src/main/resources" and write the database info according this page <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/" target="_blank">Spring Boot Mysql</a>

<!-- [Spring boot mysql](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/) -->

2. Install dependencies.

3. Run project executing the main file "FirstCrudApplication.java" using main function.

Now you can try it in localhost:8080/api/saludar, this will return "Hola mundo spring"
